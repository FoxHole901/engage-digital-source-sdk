To integrate you will need to follow these steps:

1. copy the `smcc_sdk.php` file anywhere in your public folder.
2. edit the file and change the `SMCC_SDK_ACCESS_TOKEN` constant to a random secret key.

Assuming your website is `http://www.example.com/` and you copy the `smcc_sdk.php` file in the root
folder, the `base_uri` that you provide us should be: `http://www.example.com/smcc_sdk.php`.
